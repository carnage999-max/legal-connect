<h2>Account Already Exists</h2>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Someone (hopefully you) tried to create an account on Legal Connect using this email address. However, an account with this email already exists.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <strong>Already have an account?</strong><br>
    If you already have an account, you can log in directly. If you've forgotten your password, use the password reset option.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="{{ login_url }}" class="button">Log In to Your Account</a>
    <br><br>
    <a href="{{ password_reset_url }}" class="button button-secondary">Reset Password</a>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<div class="warning-box">
    <strong>Wasn't you?</strong><br>
    If you didn't attempt to create an account, someone may have mistakenly used your email address. You can safely ignore this email.
</div>

<p>Best regards,</p>
<p><strong>The Legal Connect Team</strong></p>
